      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>Net-Harmonic Sessions is a one-day festival built for producers who love the details: clean low end, bold sound design, and the kind of groove that makes a system breathe. The event blends live electronic sets with hands-on listening experiences so you can feel how music translates from headphones to real speakers.</p>
      <p>Instead of a packed schedule that rushes you through everything, the day is designed around “focus zones.” You’ll move through short, high-impact segments—listening demos, creative prompts, and guided breakdowns—then you’ll have time to try ideas immediately. It’s less lecture, more momentum.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re making dub, dancehall, drum & bass, halftime, or experimental bass music, the goal is the same: leave with new techniques and a clearer process. You’ll also walk away with a small pack of original, royalty-free samples made specifically for the event.</p>

      <h1>Workshops</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="all_content content-2">
      <h2>Workshops</h2>
      <p>Workshops are structured like mini-studios: you’ll see a concept, hear the result, then build it with guidance. Topics include drum programming for heavy swing, bass layering that stays clean on small speakers, and creative modulation techniques for movement and texture.</p>
      <p>Each session is designed for real-world use. Instead of vague “tips,” you’ll learn repeatable workflows: how to set up a session template, how to build a sound from scratch without endless plugin scrolling, and how to finish stronger by making decisions earlier.</p>
      <p>We also include a “mix translation” segment where you compare your track on multiple playback systems. You’ll learn what changes when you move from studio monitors to car speakers, phone speakers, and a larger PA-style setup—so your music keeps its impact everywhere.</p>

    <div class="all_parallax parallax-3">
      <h1>Community</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="all_content content-3">
      <h2>Community</h2>
      <p>Net-Harmonic Sessions is built around collaboration. There are dedicated areas for quick collabs, feedback swaps, and one-on-one “track clinic” conversations where you can get a second set of ears on a mix or arrangement.</p>
      <p>The community side is intentionally welcoming and structured. You can join a beginner-friendly feedback circle, a “work-in-progress” showcase, or an advanced production roundtable. Every area has clear prompts so it never turns into random, unhelpful opinions.</p>
      <p>The best part is what happens after the event. Attendees get access to a private follow-up space where you can share updated versions of your tracks, keep collaborating, and stay connected with the people you met. It’s designed to feel like a creative network—not a one-time meetup.</p>

      <h1>Tickets</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="all_content content-4">
      <h2>Tickets (NEW)</h2>
      <p>Tickets are simple and flexible. You can choose General Admission for full access to the experience zones and listening demos, or a Workshop Pass that includes reserved seating for the hands-on sessions and downloadable project templates.</p>
      <p>If you want deeper guidance, the Mentor Add-On includes a short private consult where you can bring a track, a mix problem, or a sound design goal. You’ll get a clear next-step plan and a few targeted techniques you can apply immediately.</p>
      <p>No matter what level you choose, the goal is the same: leave with momentum. You’ll get a schedule, a clear map of the day, and enough structured activities to keep you moving forward without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
