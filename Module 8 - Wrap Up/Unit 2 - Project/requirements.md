# Instructions

## Create a site. The topic is one of your choice, so long as:
* It does not violate copyrights or trademarks in any way. A fictitious topic is recommended.
* It is NOT a topic you have used already in any assignment in this class.
 
## Choose ONE of the 3 structures we covered this semester to build your site:
* Parallax-scroll (like Unit 1 project)
* Video background + Ajax load (like m56 framework)
* Accordion (like m7)
 
## Once you have a topic and picked a structure, here are the technical specs:
* (anywhere it says replace or change it means if you use an existing structure from the course, replace or change things in it to make it your own and unique):
 
The site must have a clear identity, purpose, objective. In other words, anyone looking at the site, without you to explain it, should understand with one glance what the site is about.
At least 5 sections/panels/content areas (including "home" where appropriate)
At least 2 images in each sections/panels/content area. Make sure images are resized and well-optimized for web. No image over 1mB.
At least 2 paragraphs/text elements with at least 150 words total on each sections/panels/content. NO LIPSUM.
A meaningful link name + heading for each sections/panels/content.
Replace all images, do not use ANY of the images of any of the frameworks given by the teacher. Including icons.
Change all CSS backgrounds. Do not use ANY of the CSS colors/background-colors of any of the frameworks given by the teacher. Pick your own to fit your topic.
Site should be responsive and look good and usable on small screens (anything narrower than 640px). Use CSS media queries.
Site must be compatible with at least Firefox and Chrome
